## About color generation
This extension uses some APIs to provide functionality of generating colors from a base color or image. For generating color palette from a base color, we used [Palette.es API](https://palett.es/about), and for creating set of colors from a image we chose [Color Thief API](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/#examples).

## Extension Settings
Currently, extension does not have any settings -> look for future updates
